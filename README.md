# Jonofoz - DOOM studies

I've decided after many years of daydreaming to actually, really take the plunge
and start dissecting id Software's 'DOOM' for my own enjoyment and edification.

## "But, why?"
I _love_ old technology, and I _love_ "boomer shooters", as the kids call them now. But there's
something particularly romantic and unknown about DOOM to me: I never got to experience the craze
growing up, or to have been involved with id Software when it all came together. Like a child
wanting to know everything they can about a parent they never got to meet, I've wanted to get
closer to the experiences I missed. I've wanted to get a little more... erm... "intimate" with DOOM.

I've also always wanted to mod DOOM. I feel this is my gateway to that.

## "Um, okay... so, how are you gonna figure all of this out?"
I've long been uncertain about taking on this project, despite wanting
to do it: I had no idea where the heck, or _how_ the heck, to even start dissecting it.

But I feel like I've reached a point in my life as a developer that, if I go
about this task intelligently, I absolutely can figure this out, little by little.

## "And what's your plan, Dan?"
Obviously, there's no way I can take in everything all at once... but I can totally break it down
into smaller chunks.

### Here's my (somewhat naive) plan to chunk this app into smaller sections, without diving too much into the details:
1. Game logic
  - Movement
  - Physics
  - Parsing WADs
  - Health, damage, power-ups, stuff
2. I/O
  - Mouse control
  - Keyboard control
  - Joystick control
3. Visuals
  - Render engine
  - Various Menus
4. Audio
  - Music
  - SFX
5. Network Play
6. Compiling and Executing
7. Other stuff

Nothing of course is siloed perfectly here: various areas will inevitably overlap. But I feel I can approach my studies and roughly categorize everything into these areas.


**So here we go!**
